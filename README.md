# dotenv-cli

## Installing

NPM
```bash
$ npm install -g dotenv-cli
```

Yarn
```bash
$ yarn global add dotenv-cli
```

pnpm
```bash
pnpm add -g dotenv-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
$ dotenv <command with arguments>
```

This will load the variables from the .env file in the current working directory and then run the command (using the new set of environment variables).

### Custom .env files
Another .env file could be specified using the -e flag:
```bash
$ dotenv -e .env2 <command with arguments>
```

Multiple .env files can be specified, and will be processed in order:
```bash
$ dotenv -e .env3 -e .env4 <command with arguments>
```

### Cascading env variables
Some applications load from `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, and `.env.development.local`
(see [#37](https://github.com/entropitor/dotenv-cli/issues/37) for more information).
`dotenv-cli` supports this using the `-c` flag for just `.env` and `.env.local` and `-c development` for the ones above.
The `-c` flag can be used together with the `-e` flag. The following example will cascade env files located one folder up in the directory tree (`../.env` followed by `../.env.local`):
```bash
dotenv -e ../.env -c 
```

### Setting variable from command line
It is possible to set variable directly from command line using the -v flag:
```bash
$ dotenv -v VARIABLE=somevalue <command with arguments>
```

Multiple variables can be specified:
```bash
$ dotenv -v VARIABLE1=somevalue1 -v VARIABLE2=somevalue2 <command with arguments>
```

Variables set up from command line have higher priority than from env files.

> Purpose of this is that standard approach `VARIABLE=somevalue <command with arguments>` doesn't work on Windows. The -v flag works on all the platforms.

### Check env variable
If you want to check the value of an environment variable, use the `-p` flag
```bash
$ dotenv -p NODE_ENV
```

### Flags to the underlying command
If you want to pass flags to the inner command use `--` after all the flags to `dotenv-cli`. 

E.g. the following command without dotenv-cli:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-g -f"
```

will become the following command with dotenv-cli:
```bash
$ dotenv -- mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-g -f"
``` 
or in case the env file is at `.my-env`
```bash
$ dotenv -e .my-env -- mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-g -f"
``` 

### Variable expansion
We support expanding env variables inside .env files (See [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand) npm package for more information)

For example:
```
IP=127.0.0.1
PORT=1234
APP_URL=http://${IP}:${PORT}
```
Using the above example `.env` file, `process.env.APP_URL` would be `http://127.0.0.1:1234`.

### Variable expansion in the command

If your `.env` file looks like:

```
SAY_HI=hello!
```

you might expect `dotenv echo "$SAY_HI"` to display `hello!`. In fact, this is not what happens: your shell will first interpret your command before passing it to `dotenv-cli`, so if `SAY_HI` envvar is set to `""`, the command will be expanded into `dotenv echo`: that's why `dotenv-cli` cannot make the expansion you expect.

One possible way to get the desired result is:

```
$ dotenv -- bash -c 'echo "$SAY_HI"'
```

In bash, everything between `'` is not interpreted but passed as is. Since `$SAY_HI` is inside `''` brackets, it's passed as a string literal.

Therefore, `dotenv-cli` will start a child process `bash -c 'echo "$SAY_HI"'` with the env variable `SAY_HI` set correctly which means bash will run `echo "$SAY_HI"` in the right environment which will print correctly `hello`

### Debugging

You can add the `--debug` flag to output the `.env` files that would be processed and exit.
